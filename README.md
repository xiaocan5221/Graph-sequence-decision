# Graph-sequence-decision
Use python to determine whether a given sequence is a graph sequence and plot it.
This is a simple program to implement the graph sequence decision theorem in the book.

If you want to use this program, you must first have a python runtime environment (version 3.8 or greater), and then install networkx and matplotlib packages.
Finally, just run it with your compiler.
